Xnova is a **mobile MMO** (Massively Multiplayer Online) strategy game. 
The player starts on an empty **planet** and a small amount of **resources** (*Metal*, *Crystal*, *Deuterium* and *Energy*). Then the player can start building resource extraction 
*mines* and infrastructure to develop his planet. 

When the *Research Laboratory* is built the player can investigate new **technologies** that will allow him to make **spaceships** and **defenses**. Then, the player can:
 - **Expand** colonizing new worlds.
 - **Explore** the universe.
 - **Attack** other players for resources.
 - **Trade** with other players.
 - Form **alliances** with other players.
 
All this while playing with thousands of other players in a vast **universe** (categorized into *galaxies*, *solar systems* and *planets*). Xnova is heavily inspired by [OGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGame).

Xnova is coded in [JavaScript](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), the frontend runs on 
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). The backend is built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org),
 [Express](http://expressjs.com), [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). We created this with the aim of allowing anyone with basic 
programming skills have a Xnova server running in 5 minutes.
